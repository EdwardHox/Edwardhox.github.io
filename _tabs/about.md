## About Me
I am a student at Concordia university majoring in Aerospace engineering and currently a member of the UAV Concordia mechanical team. I spend most of my time on academic work and in my spare time, I would go out for a stroll on my scooters.

## About The Projects
Most of the projects shown here are form academic work or personal projects. Most of the projects are purely mechanical in nature, but I do have projects in other fields that may be added at a later date.
