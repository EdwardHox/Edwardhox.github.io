# Background 

This is a personal project to produce a small damper for a winch system. The objective of this project is to produce a reliable system for dropping payload from a UAV without a speed controller monitoring the descending speed.

## Description

The parts are printed using a 3D printer, however due to our schedule we have yet to test the performance of the system. The test results will be updated once the tests are conducted.

## Design
