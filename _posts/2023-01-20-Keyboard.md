# Background 
This is a passion project of a high school friend who now is a computer engineer. In this project, I mainly help designing the shell of the keyboard.

This assembly model is the left side case for the keyboard. The model is made in Inventor and currently, I'm porting it to Solidworks. This is the mini version of the keyboard and if you are interested in an ergonomic Keyboard you can check out [this link](https://davinci-ergo-lab.com/)
