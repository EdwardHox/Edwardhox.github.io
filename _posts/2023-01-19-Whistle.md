# Background 
This is the course project for AERO 455. The objective of this project is to study acoustics using turbulent models. We plan to use URANS models to resolve the pressure waves generated by the flow and if time allows LES is also a possibility.
## Geometry

### Whistle Drawing

The geometry of the whistle is designed using Solidworks, three prototypes are made using 3d printers, and the frequency is measured to be around 2519 hz.

## Meshing
A mesh-independent study is conducted to determine to find the fineness of the mesh grid. The mesh is made using quadrahedral mesh and refined near the wall surface to reduce the y+ to nearly 15.

## Simulation 
In this case, three models are used to generate the flow field: k-epsilon, k-omega, and k-kl-omega. Running transient simulations with a time step of 1e-5 s, at 0.03s the flow field is captured.

## Current progress 

 We have analyzed the acoustic behavior using FWH acoustic model, however, the results using URANS are much lower than the measured value. Currently we are preparing a mesh for an LES simulation.
