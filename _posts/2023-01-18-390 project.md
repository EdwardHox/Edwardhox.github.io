# Background 

This is the course project of AERO 390. The Scope of the project is to design a mock multifunction spoiler actuation system for the bombardie challenger 300. The design objective is to implement new actuation technology on this aircraft. In this project, I redesigned the mounting and mechanical links and analyzed the dynamic behaviour of the system.

## Description

The structure design and dynamic simulation are conducted using Solidworks; the aerodynamic load on the spoiler is also tested using the built-in CFD function. It is acknowledged that the simulation results are not perfectly accurate, but the evidence of the simulation aided greatly in generating and evaluating prototype designs.
