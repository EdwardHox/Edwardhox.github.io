# Background 

This is the course project of AERO 390. The Scope of the project is to design a mock multifunction spoiler actuation system for the bombardie challenger 300. The design objective is to implement new actuation technology on this aircraft. In this project, I redesigned the mounting and mechanical links and analyzed the dynamic behaviour of the system.

## Description

The structure design and dynamic simulation are conducted using Solidworks; the aerodynamic load on the spoiler is also tested using the built-in CFD function. It is acknowledged that the simulation results are not perfectly accurate, but the evidence of the simulation aided greatly in generating and evaluating prototype designs.

## Design process 

### Preliminary sizing 
The goal of this analysis is to determine the peak hinge moment experienced by the spoiler structure in flight. Therefore, several preliminary test cases are designed to find the peak load scenario. The fight conditions are selected based on the Bombardier operating manual. From the flight envelope, the highest operational flight speed at the lowest permitted altitude is selected to produce maximum stress on the spoilers. The hinge moment is evaluated using CFD analysis for different angle of deflection.

## Detailed Design 

The goal of this section is to determine the optimal geometry of the spoiler hinge and actuator placement. Following the given design philosophy of simplicity, trunnion type mount is selected to reduce the number of parts and improve accessibility for maintenance compared to flange type mounts. 

With the type of mechanism determined, the geometry objective is constructed. The goal of the linkage design is to maximize the mechanical leverage at the position where the highest load is applied to the actuator. Based on the aerodynamic analysis, the highest load occurred at full spoiler deflection at 45 degrees, thus the mechanical leverage or effective hinge arm should gradually increase and reach maximum at the full deflection angle of 45 degrees.

Reflecting to the basis of the theory of machine and considering the plane perpendicular to the hinge line, the trunnion-type design can be simplified to a slider four-bar mechanism with the spoiler and trunnion mount on the wing structure considered as the fixed bar. To achieve this design objective, the hinge arm on the spoiler bar must meet the sliding actuator bar at 90 degrees at full deflection. With this requirement, the direction of the three floating bars can be determined at a fully deflected position. 

To reduce the space occupied by the system, it was decided placing the actuator nearly parallel to the chord line would be the most volume efficient structure placement of the actuation system

### Planer geometry of the actuation system

Respecting the simple and cost-effective philosophy, the design would reuse the existing mounting position on the spoilers and spars. However, due to the limited availability of the information, the position of the hinges must be assumed. Based on the findings of the CFD analysis, the location of the actuators and hinges are placed preliminarily as the space constraint due to the structures are currently unknown. On both spoilers, the actuator is placed at the center of pressure; two hinges are placed near the edges of each spoiler. This design is made to reduce the number of parts to reduce the manufacturing cost and simplify the structure.

For the simplicity of the design and ease of maintenance, inboard and outboard actuation mechanism will share the same parts. As the inboard spoiler experiences higher stresses; the sizing for the inboard spoiler will be sufficient for the outboard spoilers

### Hydraulic Sizing
Based on the results of preliminary sizing and geometry study, the preliminary structure design is defined. For detailed sizing on the actuator, the actuator is simplified as a circular cylinder. The sizing condition is based on physical stresses on components such as compressive and loop stress on the structure. As discussed in the geometry study, four parameters are selected from the planar view below.

Below assumptions are used to constraint the design.

•	The overall safety factor of the structure should be at least 1.5 (SC014)

•	At full deflection of the spoiler, the hinge arm is perpendicular to the actuator 

•	The cylinder must withstand the peak hydraulic pressure of 3000Psi (C009)


For the structure to fit in the wing section; the hinge arm length should be longer than the radius of the actuator cylinder. Being cost and volume efficient while keeping maintainability in mind, the structure must be small to retain sufficient space for surrounding components while leaving sufficient space for the upper wing structure. Therefore, the value of 35mm is chosen as an acceptable balance between the two. The dimension of the components is determined by the constraint diagram.

The design parameter is then used to construct the model of the actuation system above to obtain the stroke length based on kinematic analysis. 

## Load and Response Analysis 
This section aims to evaluate the static loading on the actuator as the spoiler deploys at maximum loading scenario and the linear to angular motion transfer behavior of the structure design. The analysis was conducted through SolidWorks motion study. An assembly file is constructed for the designed geometry. A linear motor of constant velocity is placed on the actuator to enable the mechanism's motion and the angular displacement on the spoiler is measured as a function of time. To compute the loading on the actuator, a torque is placed on the hinge, the magnitude is written as function of time based on the position of the spoiler according to the CFD results. 

Based on the constructed model, the linear to angular motion and actuator load are measured and illustrated in the below figures. From the obtain the result; the transfer from linear to angular motion is almost linear and from the plot, a transfer function can be obtained through interpolation. For load analysis, actuator force increases with the deflection position and the peak load magnitude corresponds with the calculated value with the constraint diagram, thus the verifies the sizing of the actuator is accurate.
